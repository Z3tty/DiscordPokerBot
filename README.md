# DiscordPokerBot
A bot for playing Texas Holdem over Discord. Requires Python3.1+ and discord.py, however the setup batch file handles that library.

# How to use
Download the files, then go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and click New App.
Copy the Bot token, and then go here https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0, give it all non-administrative permissions, and then invite it to your server.
Run setup.bat and give it your bot token.

Finally, simply start run.bat, and have fun playing with your friends!
